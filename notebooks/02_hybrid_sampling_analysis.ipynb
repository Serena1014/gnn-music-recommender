      "ORIGINAL HYBRID METHOD:\n",
      "  • Target: 50,000 playlists → 661k+ nodes\n",
      "  • Training: 34-60 minutes per config\n",
      "  • Total experiment time: 4-6 hours\n",
      "\n",
      "SCALED HYBRID METHOD (THIS OUTPUT):\n",
      "  • Target: 2,500 playlists → ~112,433 nodes\n",
      "  • Training: 3-5 minutes per config\n",
      "  • Total experiment time: 40-65 minutes\n",
      "\n",
      "🎯 SAME METHODOLOGY, CONTROLLED SCALE!\n",
      "   ✅ Identical core-based filtering logic\n",
      "   ✅ Identical stratified sampling approach\n",
      "   ✅ Identical priority scoring system\n",
      "   ✅ Perfect for experimental consistency\n",
      "\n",
      "📋 PARAMETER ADJUSTMENTS FOR SCALE CONTROL:\n",
      "   • min_track_frequency: 5 → 8 (stricter core filtering)\n",
      "   • min_user_playlists: 3 → 10 (better user consolidation)\n",
      "   • target_playlists: 50,000 → 2,500 (experimental scale)\n",
      "   • User ID extraction: more aggressive consolidation\n",
      "\n",
      "🔬 EXPERIMENTAL BENEFITS:\n",
      "   ✅ Can run all 13 configurations in ~1 hour\n",
      "   ✅ Same methodology across Experiments 1, 2, and 3\n",
      "   ✅ Manageable memory usage (~1-2GB vs 4-6GB)\n",
      "   ✅ Statistical validity maintained\n",
      "   ✅ Perfect for thesis experimental design\n"
